- How should one implement a scientific calculator e.g. able to perform "complex" calculations like processing an expression with multiple operators, parentheses, ... ?
- How one should implement the "memory" feature in a calculator? Is a global variable a good idea?
- How to efficiently and beautifully assign functions to classes and ids? Maybe go with dictionnary (class vs id, function to attach) and define a function to assign all classes/ids with identified function ? Maybe some frameworks have some shortcuts for that given it's something you always have to do ?
